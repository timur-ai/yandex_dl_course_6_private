## MCP Usage Policy

This policy standardizes how Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers are used in this repository and in associated automation.

### Approved Servers
- context7: Primary source for library, framework, and API documentation.
- Additional servers may be allowed on a case‑by‑case basis after review.

### Usage Guidelines
- Use context7 exclusively for technical references, API clarifications, and examples.
- Do not query, configure, or auto‑fallback to any other MCP servers.
- Query MCP when:
  - You need authoritative docs or recent changes for a dependency
  - You need examples or best practices from an official source
  - Local repository context is insufficient to proceed accurately
- Do not rely on MCP for secrets, credentials, or proprietary content.
- Cache and cite key facts retrieved via MCP in code comments or docs when decisions depend on them. Include version and retrieval date when relevant.

### Query Quality
- Ask focused, unambiguous questions (one topic per query).
- Include versions (e.g., "PyTorch 2.3+", "Python 3.12+") when relevant.
- Prefer official docs over blogs or third‑party sources.

### Reproducibility
- When MCP output informs implementation choices, record:
  - Source server and doc URL or identifier
  - Library/framework version
  - Short summary of the guidance followed

### Security & Compliance
- Treat MCP output as untrusted until verified against official sources.
- Do not paste secrets into queries. Redact sensitive details.
- Respect licenses and attribution requirements of cited materials.

### Automation Integration
- Tools and scripts invoking MCP must:
  - Fail closed when the server is unavailable and provide a clear message
  - Support offline mode with degraded behavior where feasible
  - Log queries at debug level without sensitive data
  - Deduplicate repeated queries via simple caching where possible

### Review Checklist
- Is the selected MCP server appropriate and approved?
- Are versions and sources cited where they affect implementation?
- Is sensitive information excluded from queries and logs?

## Language Policy for Repository Content

This policy defines language requirements for all artifacts in this repository.

### Scope
- Source code, tests, notebooks, examples
- Comments, docstrings, READMEs, and documentation
- Logs, error messages, CLI output strings
- File/folder names and configuration keys
- Commit messages, PR/issue titles and descriptions

Note: This policy governs repository content and automation output. It does not constrain interactive chat responses unless explicitly requested.

### Requirements
- Use English only (American English preferred) across the entire scope.
- Use clear, precise technical terminology; avoid slang and colloquialisms.
- Use consistent terminology for concepts and components across files.
- Write user‑facing text (errors, warnings, help) in plain, actionable English.
- Use ISO‑8601 dates (YYYY‑MM‑DD) and UTC timestamps where applicable.
- Avoid mixed‑language content, transliteration, or Cyrillic characters.

### Prohibited
- Non‑English words in code, docs, or commit messages
- Mixed language sentences or transliterated technical terms

### Review Checklist
- All added/edited text is in English and consistent in terminology
- Identifiers and filenames use English words and follow PEP 8 conventions
- User‑facing messages are clear, concise, and actionable
- No Cyrillic or mixed‑language fragments remain

### Acceptance Criteria
Pull requests that violate this policy must receive changes‑requested until they comply. Automated checks may be added to enforce key aspects (e.g., filename linting and commit message linting).
